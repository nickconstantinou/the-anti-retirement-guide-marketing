  { q: 'What is The Anti-Retirement Guide about?', a: "It's for people who are close to retirement — or financially ready — but haven't been able to move. Not because the money isn't there. Because the thing on the other side doesn't have a shape yet. The book helps you give it one." },
  { q: 'Who is this book for?', a: "People who've spent 30 years being genuinely good at something and find the idea of stopping is not simple. It works whether you're choosing this transition or whether a redundancy, health scare, or restructure has made the decision for you." },
  { q: "What's the main message?", a: "This is not a financial plan — your IFA handles that. This book sits next to the spreadsheet and asks what the numbers are in service of. It's about identity, structure, belonging, and designing what comes next." },
  { q: 'Why should I trust the author?', a: "Nick is 54, still working, and writing from inside the decision he hasn't made yet. He's not a financial adviser, not a life coach, and not someone who has already figured this out. He wrote the book he couldn't find: honest about the fear, specific about the money, and clear-eyed about the parts that don't resolve neatly." },
  { q: "My spouse is not ready to retire. What do I do?", a: "The book covers this directly — including a structured framework for the conversation most couples avoid for years. The key insight: couples on completely different timelines need a different approach than the standard retirement planning playbook offers." },
  { q: "I'm an introvert. Do I have to build a big social life?", a: "'Join a club' is not the answer this book gives you. There's a dedicated section on social connection for introverts — building the right kind of structure before you leave, not a packed calendar that doesn't fit who you are." },
  { q: "I was made redundant — is this book still relevant?", a: "Yes. The book works for both people who are choosing this transition and those who arrived here without choosing it. Some sections are written specifically for people facing an unexpected crossroads." },
  { q: "I'm self-employed — is my situation covered?", a: "Part Five includes a dedicated guide for the self-employed exit. Leaving when you own the business is a different problem — and it gets its own treatment." },
  { q: "What is the First Week Guide?", a: "A free seven-day exercise guide to get you unstuck. One exercise per day, 20–30 minutes each. By the end of the week you'll have named what's actually stopping you and have a clearer picture of what comes next." },
  { q: 'What format is the book available in?', a: "It will be available in Kindle and paperback formats. The publish date is still to be confirmed, so the site currently lists it as coming soon." },
